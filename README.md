# TaskUp: Break it Down
*Do you ever get overwhelemed with big assignments and don't even know where to start? TaskUp allows users to break up their big projects into smaller tasks and assign days to complete these tasks. Users can view their tasks by day or by project. In addition, TaskUp prioritizes the design of these checklists, allowing users the satisfaction of checking something off and further motivating them to complete their tasks*
